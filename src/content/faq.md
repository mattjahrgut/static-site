# Cat Care FAQ

## How often should I feed my cat?

Most adult cats do well with two meals per day, but this can vary based on age, health, and activity level. Kittens need more frequent feeding (3-4 times daily), while senior cats might prefer smaller, more frequent meals.

## Why does my cat knead me?

Kneading (also called "making biscuits") is a comforting behavior from kittenhood. When cats knead, they're showing contentment and marking you with their scent glands. It's a sign of trust and affection!

## How can I tell if my cat is sick?

Watch for changes in:
- **Appetite**: Eating more or less than usual
- **Litter box habits**: Frequency or consistency changes
- **Energy levels**: Unusual lethargy or hyperactivity
- **Behavior**: Hiding, aggression, or unusual vocalization

When in doubt, consult your veterinarian.

## Should I let my cat go outside?

This is a personal decision with pros and cons. Indoor cats typically live longer and are safer from predators, cars, and diseases. If you do let your cat outside, consider supervised time or a secure outdoor enclosure.

## Why does my cat bring me "gifts"?

When your cat brings you dead (or sometimes live) prey, they're showing you they care! In the wild, mother cats bring food to their kittens, so your cat is treating you like family.

## How can I stop my cat from scratching furniture?

Provide appropriate scratching posts and pads. Place them near furniture your cat likes to scratch. Use positive reinforcement when they use the right surfaces, and consider deterrents like double-sided tape on furniture.

## Is it normal for my cat to sleep so much?

Yes! Adult cats sleep 12-16 hours per day on average. This is normal behavior - cats are crepuscular (most active at dawn and dusk) and conserve energy for hunting and play.
