# Learning Web Development

*Published on December 19, 2024*

Web development can seem overwhelming at first, but it doesn't have to be. Here's my approach to learning web technologies.

## Start Simple

When I began learning web development, I made the mistake of jumping into complex frameworks too early. The key is to master the fundamentals first:

- **HTML**: Structure your content
- **CSS**: Style your pages
- **JavaScript**: Add interactivity

## The Learning Path

### 1. HTML Basics
Learn semantic HTML elements and proper document structure.

### 2. CSS Fundamentals
Understand selectors, properties, and layout techniques.

### 3. JavaScript Essentials
Start with variables, functions, and DOM manipulation.

### 4. Build Projects
Apply what you learn by building real projects.

## My Favorite Resources

- **MDN Web Docs**: Comprehensive documentation
- **FreeCodeCamp**: Interactive tutorials
- **YouTube**: Visual learning
- **Practice**: Build, build, build!

## Common Pitfalls

- **Skipping fundamentals**: Don't rush to frameworks
- **Analysis paralysis**: Just start building
- **Perfectionism**: Done is better than perfect

## The Journey Continues

Web development is a continuous learning process. There's always something new to discover, and that's what makes it exciting!
